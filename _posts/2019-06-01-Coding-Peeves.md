# Code Peeves

- Spelling mistakes
- Overuse of OO Patterns
- Convoluted logic
- Overuse of typings - when it makes code less readable
- Really large components - super components
- Coders obbessed with tests who write bad tests
- Too much logic in ui components
- Undescriptive names
- Coders who dont want to learn HTML and CSS but call themselves full stack
